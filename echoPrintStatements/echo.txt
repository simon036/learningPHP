both echo and print are used to output data
differences =
        echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions 
        echo can make multiple parameters while print only takes one arguement
        echo is faster than print 

ECHO STATEMENT  
 can be used with or without parameters 
  eg echo "hello";
      is same as echo ("hello");

Display text
    echo "<h2>PHP is Fun!</h2>";
    echo "Hello world!<br>";
    echo "I'm about to learn PHP!<br>";
    echo "This ", "string ", "was ", "made ", "with multiple parameters.";

Display Variables
    $name1 = "Simon";
    $name2 = "Mufasa";

    echo "<h2>name1</h2>
    echo "<p> Second name is $name2</p?

USING SINGLE QUOTES
When using double quotes, variables can be inserted to the string
When using single quotes, variables have to be inserted using the . operator

        $name1 = "Simon";
        $name2 = "Mufasa";

        echo '<h2>' . $name1 . '</h2>';
        echo '<p>' Second name is .  $name2  . '</p>';
