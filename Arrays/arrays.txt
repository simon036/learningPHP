Array = stores multiple values in one single variable 
    and to access the values we use indexes

example ;
    $cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");

three types of arrays ;

    1. indexed arrays
    2. associative arrays
    3. multidimensional arrays 

array items
    most common are strings and numbers (int, float), but array items can also be objects, functions or even arrays
    one can have diff data types in same array

example;
    $myArr = array("Volvo", 15, ["apples", "bananas"], myFunction);


array functions 
    eg count() fn 
    example: 
        How many items are in the $cars array?

        $cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
        echo count($cars)
