we create arrays using the array() fn 
example;
    $cars = array ("benz","bmw", "Toyota");

we can also use the [] brackets
        $cars = array ["benz","bmw", "Toyota"];

multiple lines 
    $cars = [
        "Volvo",
        "BMW",
        "Toyota"
    ];

Array keys
    When creating indexed arrays the keys are given automatically, 
    starting at 0 and increased by 1 for each item

    example :
        $cars = [
            0 => "Volvo",
            1 => "BMW",
            2 =>"Toyota"
        ];

Indexed arrays are the same as associative arrays,
but associative arrays have names instead of numbers

example;
    $myCar = [
        "brand" => "Ford",
        "model" => "Mustang",
        "year" => 1964
    ];

Declaring an empty array
One can declare an empty array first and then add items to it later 
example;
    $cars = [];
    $cars[0] = "Volvo";
    $cars[1] = "BMW";
    $cars[2] = "Toyota";

same goes for associative arrays
example ;
    $myCar = [];
    $myCar["brand"] = "Ford";
    $myCar["model"] = "Mustang";
    $myCar["year"] = 1964;

mixing array keys
we can have arrays with both indexed and named keys
example;
    $myArr = [];
    $myArr[0] = "apples";
    $myArr[1] = "bananas";
    $myArr["fruit"] = "cherries";
