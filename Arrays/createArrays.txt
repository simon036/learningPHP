we create arrays using the array() fn 
example;
    $cars = array ("benz","bmw", "Toyota");

we can also use the [] brackets
        $cars = array ["benz","bmw", "Toyota"];

multiple lines 
    $cars = [
        "Volvo",
        "BMW",
        "Toyota"
    ];

Array keys
    When creating indexed arrays the keys are given automatically, 
    starting at 0 and increased by 1 for each item

    example :
        $cars = [
            0 => "Volvo",
            1 => "BMW",
            2 =>"Toyota"
        ];

Indexed arrays are the same as associative arrays,
but associative arrays have names instead of numbers

example;
    $myCar = [
        "brand" => "Ford",
        "model" => "Mustang",
        "year" => 1964
    ];
