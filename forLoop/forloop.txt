For Loop 
used to loop through code block a specified no. of times

syntax
    for (expression1, expression2, expression3) {
    // code block
    }

how it works:

expression1 is evaluated once
expression2 is evaluated before each iteration
expression3 is evaluated after each iteration

Example;
    Print the numbers from 0 to 10:

        for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
        echo "The number is: $x <br>";
        }
explanation:
1.The first expression, $x = 0;, is evaluated once and sets a counter to 0.
2.The second expression, $x <= 10;, is evaluated before each iteration, and the code block is only executed if this expression evaluates to true. In this example the expression is true as long as $x is less than, or equal to, 10.
3.The third expression, $x++;, is evaluated after each iteration, and in this example, the expression increases the value of $x by one at each iteration.

break statement
stops loop even if condition is true
        Example
        Stop the loop when $x is 3:

        for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
        if ($x == 3) break;
        echo "The number is: $x <br>";
        }
