Do while loop
loops through code block once and repeats loop as long as condition is true

example ;

Print $i as long as $i is less than 6:

        $i = 1;

        do {
            echo $i;
            $i++;
        } while ($i < 6);

Note: In a do...while loop the condition is tested AFTER executing the statements within the loop. This means that the do...while loop will execute its statements at least once, even if the condition is false

example ;
Set $i = 8, then print $i as long as $i is less than 6:

        $i = 8;

        do {
            echo $i;
            $i++;
        } while ($i < 6);
code will be executed once ,even if condition is never true

BREAK STATEMENT
break ststement stops loop even if condition is still true
    example ;
        Stop the loop when $x is 3:

        for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
            if ($x == 3) break;
            echo "The number is: $x <br>";
        }

continue statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

Example
    Stop, and jump to the next iteration if $x is 3:

    for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
        if ($x == 3) continue;
        echo "The number is: $x <br>";
    }

Example
    counts to 100 by tens:

    Example
    for ($x = 0; $x <= 100; $x+=10) {
        echo "The number is: $x <br>";
    }
