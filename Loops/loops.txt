LOOPS = used to execute same block of code again and again as long as condition is true

1. while loop = loops through block of code as long as condition is true
2.do while loop = loops through block of code once ans then repeats loop as long as specified condition is true
3. for loop = loops through block of code a specified no. of times
4. for each = loops via code block for each element in an array

1 . WHILE LOOP 
loops through block of code as long as condition is true

example ;
    Print $i as long as $i is less than 6:

            $i = 1;
            while ($i < 6) {
            echo $i;
            $i++;
            }
Note: remember to increment $i, or else the loop will continue forever.

BREAK STATEMENT 
break statement stops loop even if condition is still true

example;
Stop the loop when $i is 3:

    $i = 1;
    while ($i < 6) {
    if ($i == 3) break;
    echo $i;
    $i++;
    }

CONTINUE STATEMENT
continue statement stops current iteration and continue with the next

example;
Stop, and jump to the next iteration if $i is 3:

        $i = 0;
        while ($i < 6) {
        $i++;
        if ($i == 3) continue;
        echo $i;
        }

    alternative 
        The while loop syntax can also be written with the endwhile statement like this

        Example
        Print $i as long as $i is less than 6:

                $i = 1;
                while ($i < 6):
                echo $i;
                $i++;
                endwhile;
