Switch statements selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

syntax
    switch (expression) {
        case label1:
            //code 
            break;
        case label2:
            //code 
            break;
        case label3:
            //code 
            break;
        default:
            //code 
    }

how it works:

The expression is evaluated once
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
The break keyword breaks out of the switch block
The default code block is executed if there is no match

example ;
    $favcolor = "red";

        switch ($favcolor) {
        case "red":
            echo "Your favorite color is red!";
            break;
        case "blue":
            echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
            break;
        case "green":
            echo "Your favorite color is green!";
            break;
        default:
            echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
    }


BREAK KEYWORD
break = breaks out the switch block

DEFAULT KEYWORD
default =  specifies the code to run if there is no case match

example ;
If no cases get a match, the default block is executed:

        $d = 4;

        switch ($d) {
            case 6:
                echo "Today is Saturday";
                break;
            case 0:
                echo "Today is Sunday";
                break;
            default:
                echo "Looking forward to the Weekend";
        }


If you want multiple cases to use the same code block, you can specify the cases like this
example ;
    $d = 3;

    switch ($d) {
        case 1:
        case 2:
        case 3:
        case 4:
        case 5:  
            echo "The weeks feels so long!";
            break;
        case 6:
        case 0:
            echo "Weekends are the best!";
            break;
        default:
            echo "Something went wrong";
    }
