Conditional statements
    if = executes code if one condition is true
    if else = executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
    if elseif else  =  executes diff codes for more than two conditions 
    switch  = selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

1 .if statement

executes if one condition is true

    if (condition){
        //code 
    }
example ;
    if (5>3){
        echo "Have a good day";
    }

with variables ==>

    $a = 10;
    if ($a < 20){
        echo "Have a good day";
    }



2. using Comparison operators
used to compare two values using if statement
example ;
    $a = 14;

    if ($a == 14) {
    echo "Have a good day!";
    }

Operator	Name	                    Result	
==	        Equal	                    Returns true if the values are equal	
===	        Identical	                Returns true if the values and data types are identical	
!=	        Not equal	                Returns true if the values are not equal	
<>	        Not equal	                Returns true if the values are not equal	
!==     	Not identical	            Returns true if the values or data types are not identical	
>	        Greater than	            Returns true if the first value is greater than the second value	
<	        Less than	                Returns true if the first value is less than the second value	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	Returns true if the first value is greater than, or equal to, the second value	
<=	        Less than or equal to	    Returns true if the first value is less than, or equal to, the second value


3. Logical operators
checks  more than one condition.use logical operators

example;
    Check if $a is greater than $b, AND if $a is less than $c:

        $a = 200;
        $b = 33;
        $c = 500;

        if ($a > $b && $a < $c ) {
        echo "Both conditions are true";
        }


Operator	Name	    Description
and	        And	        True if both conditions are true	
&&	        And	        True if both conditions are true	
or	        Or	        True if either condition is true	
||	        Or	        True if either condition is true	
xor	        Xor	        True if either condition is true, but not both	
!	        Not	        True if condition is not true


Example
    Check if $a is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7:

        $a = 5;

        if ($a == 2 || $a == 3 || $a == 4 || $a == 5 || $a == 6 || $a == 7) {
        echo "$a is a number between 2 and 7";
        }
