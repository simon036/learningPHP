Escape character
    used to  insert xters that are illegal in a string
    defined by a backslash \ followed by xter you want to insert

example;

    $x = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";

Now we use the escape character \ "

    $x = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
