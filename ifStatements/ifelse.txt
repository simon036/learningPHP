if else 
executes some code if a condition is true and another if that condition is false

syntax 
        if (condition){
            //code to be executed if condition is true
        } else {
            //code to be executed if condition is false 
        }
    example;
            Output "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20, and "Have a good night!" otherwise:

                $t = date("H");

                if ($t < "20") {
                echo "Have a good day!";
                } else {
                echo "Have a good night!";
                }

The if ..elseif..else statement
executes diff codes for more than two conditions

syntax
    if (condition){
        //code to be executed if condition is true
    }elseif (condition){
        // code executed if first condition is false and this condition is true
    } else {
       // code executed if all conditions are false 
    }

example ;
    Output "Have a good morning!" if the current time is less than 10, and "Have a good day!" if the current time is less than 20. Otherwise it will output "Have a good night!":

        $t = date("H");

        if ($t < "10") {
            echo "Have a good morning!";
        } elseif ($t < "20") {
            echo "Have a good day!";
        } else {
            echo "Have a good night!";
        }
