constants = are like variables, once defined they cannot be changes or undefined
is an identifier(name)
starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign bfor constant name)
are automaticaly global across entire script

1. creating php constant 
we use define() fn 
    define(name , value)
example ;  Create a constant with a case-sensitive name:

    define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");
    echo GREETING;
        // Welcome to W3Schools.com!

2.const keyword
example : Create a case-sensitive constant with the const keyword:

    const MYCAR = "Volvo";
    echo MYCAR;
        //Volvo 
NOTE :
    const vs. define()
    const cannot be created inside another block scope, like inside a function or inside an if statement.
    define() can be created inside another block scope.


CONSTANT ARRAYS 
we use define() fn 
Example :
    define("cars", [
        "Toyota",
        "Golf",
        "BMW"
    ]);
    echo cars[0];

Constants are global and can be used across entire script
example:
    define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");

    function myTest() {
    echo GREETING;
    }

    myTest();
